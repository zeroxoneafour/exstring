# exstring
A string library, that is, above all, simple.  
Contains one struct, `exString`.  
If `EXSTRING_USE_STRING` is defined, you can use only `string`.  
Contains many C standard-like functions for management, such as
* excpy
* excat
* exlen
* exchr

To use exstring, put exstring.c and exstring.h in your source directory.
